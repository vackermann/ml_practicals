# Machine Learning practical work

## Convolutional Networks

- TensorFlow implementation of CNN with various filters to classify MNIST data set of handwritten digits
- Vizalization of highest activation patches of the first convolutional layer on the first 25 filters

## Generative vs Discriminative Models

- Goal: Qualitatively reproduce some of the experimental results in paper 
*"On Discriminative vs. Generative classifiers: A comparison of logistic regression and naive Bayes"* by Andrew Y. Ng and Michael I. Jordan (Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) 2001).
- Own Python implementation of Naive Bayes Classifier
- Experimental comparison of classification performance of generative models (here: naive Bayes) vs. discriminative models (here: logistic regression) on iris dataset and congressional voting records dataset
- Functionality to plot training vs test error learning-curves on increasing dataset size (using Python Matplot library)

## Machine Learning Basics
- Own Python implementation of linear regression using the least squares method
- Functionality to plot learning curve in order to check for under-/overfitting
